# Turret-Minigame-written-in-python
Hi, this is a little "Turret Minigame" written in python where you shoot small moving dots with a turret. For every dot you hit, you get score points. If your turret gets hit by the dots too often, you die...  
It's just written from scratch, so don't expect high-end performance and hours of exciting gameplay. 
(But I want to steadily develop it.)
